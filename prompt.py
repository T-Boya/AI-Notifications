prompt = "Give 10 conversation topics I can use on a date today. Include a write up with context for each so I can be informed on the topic. Spread the topics across domains (pop culture, science, non-political news, etc). These should be more specific, something I can bring up on a date when first meeting something that is specific enough to talk about but also sufficiently generic that the conversation can flow from there to other topics. Each should have a title and context. They should be timely and relevant to today"
